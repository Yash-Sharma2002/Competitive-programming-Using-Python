# QUESTIONS

# Virus Outbreak
# In the Martian land faraway, a new virus has evolved and is attacking the individuals at a fast pace. The scientists have figured out the virus composition, V. The big task is to identify the people who are infected. The sample of N people is taken to check if they are POSITIVE or NEGATIVE. A report is generated which provides the current blood composition B of the person. 


# POSITIVE or NEGATIVE ?

# If the blood composition of the person is a subsequence of the virus composition V, then the person is identified as POSITIVE otherwise NEGATIVE.


# Example:

# Virus Composition, V = coronavirus

# Blood Composition of the person , B = ravus


# The person in question is POSITIVE as B is the subsequence of the V. 

 

# The scientists are busy with their research for medicine and request you to build a program which can quickly figure out if the person is POSITIVE or NEGATIVE. They will provide you with the virus composition V and all the peopleâ€™s current blood composition. Can you help them?


# Note: The virus and blood compositions are lowercase alphabet strings.

# Input Format
# The first line of the input consists of the virus composition, V

# The second line of he input consists of the number of people, N

# Next N lines each consist of the blood composition of the ith person, Bi




# Constraints
# 1<= N <=10

# 1<= |B|<= |V|<= 10^5



# Output Format
# For each person, print POSITIVE or NEGATIVE in a separate line
